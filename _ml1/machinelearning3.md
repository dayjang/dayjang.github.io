### Linear Regression

Assumption 1: Regression is linear in parameters & correctly specified <br>
Assumption 2: `Error terms`
> Error terms are normally distributed <br>
> Error terms have constant variance for every observation, ->  $Var({\epsilon_i})={\sigma^2}$ for every i <br>
> Error terms are uncorrelated across observations, ->  $cov({\epsilon_i},{\epsilon_j})=0$ for two observations i and j

Assumption 3: no perfect multi-collinearity within `independent variables`
